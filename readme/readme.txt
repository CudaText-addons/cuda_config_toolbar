Plugin for CudaText.
Allows to config main toolbar (on the top):

1) Choose icon set, for standard buttons. 
Many icon sets are shipped with plugin.

2) Config additional buttons (to standard buttons).
For additional buttons you can customize: 
- caption, 
- tooltip, 
- icon file (size can be any, can mismatch icon set), 
- command: usual CudaText commands and plugin commands allowed, you can choose both in menu (like Commands dialog)

Note: buttons can have caption only, or icon only, or caption+icon.
Note: buttons cannot be added during configuring session, they will add on CudaText start.
